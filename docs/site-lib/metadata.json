LONG-RANGE TRANSPORT SHIP, RENTED CABIN\n<a data-href=\"Barille Black\" href=\"the-starforged-(nickarrow)/characters/barille-black.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Barille Black</a> is sleeping on a stiff bed, wearing his dark blue suit and tie, loosened at the neck. He has dark curly hair, and the stubble of a beard. Character Goal:Gain Riches, Seek Power <br>Growing up within the domain of a founder clan, the <a data-href=\"Circle of the Elder Stars\" href=\"the-starforged-(nickarrow)/factions/circle-of-the-elder-stars.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Circle of the Elder Stars</a>, Barille's childhood was difficult. Not being of notable bloodline meant that he was relegated to the lower ranks of the Circle's caste system. However, his ability to fight, endure, and complete jobs earned him a reputation that helped elevate his status. Working jobs meant that he was able to grow his reputation, which provided access to bigger and better jobs. Barille has since left the Circle, for reasons unknown, and is currently adrift in the sector <a data-href=\"Devil's Chain\" href=\"the-starforged-(nickarrow)/locations/sectors/devil's-chain.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Devil's Chain</a>, moving from job to job. <br>\nWhen Barille left the Circle he made a vow, to <a data-href=\"Establish a new noble house in the Circle of the Elder Stars\" href=\"the-starforged-(nickarrow)/progress/barille/establish-a-new-noble-house-in-the-circle-of-the-elder-stars.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Establish a new noble house in the Circle of the Elder Stars</a>. A house that would surpass all others and become the dominant authority within the faction. Barille is on a transport ship. Not having an FTL capable ship of his own, he has to buy or barter his way to systems or sectors. He is already on a job, a posted job for the <a data-href=\"Risen Union\" href=\"the-starforged-(nickarrow)/factions/risen-union.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Risen Union</a> (RU). The RU has a reputation of keeping its cards close to the vest, but the jobs pay well, even if they tend to come with little information and lead to more questions than answers. Barille has sworn a vow for this job, to Investigate and report on the rumored horrors of Reck and he means to see it through. Barille is suddenly thrown out of his rented bed aboard the transport ship as the ship rocks violently. Either it is under attack or something catastrophic has happened. The damage is significant.BARILLE\nGood gods. I’m trying to get some sleep TODAY! He stumbles to his feat, pushes buttons on the nearby panel trying to access the ship’s systems. Gather Information(Wits); 4 vs 5|3 Barille opens crew door to see klaxons flashing, people shouting down the call. He sees a crewman running by.BARILLE\nHey, what's going on? CREWMAN\nWe're under attack, someone's shooting! Yeah, this is not ideal. This is a transport, not a warship. Not wanting to explode, Barille reaches into his pocket and flips a black iron coin. He catches it and then says to himself.BARILLE\nOn this iron I swear to Swear an Iron Vow(Heart); 6 vs 9|5 Fend off attackers until the transport can escape Okay - not sure who these hostiles are, nor why they’d be going after us? Straight up piracy? Going to need to deal with the immediate, and very explody, problem - and then figure out who is actually attacking transport ships out here. Barille pulls up the UI from his hand terminal, and initiates the pre-launch sequence for his snub fighter. Green check marks. Great, let’s get there. Barille takes off to the hanger bay. Does he get there without issue? 50/50:Yes The ship rocks a bit, sounds like the transport pilot is making moves, but no major new strikes. Barille jumps into his SN-27 snub fighter, the engines are already humming. He punches the launch control and blasts out into the void.Enter the Fray(Snub Fighter / Integrity); 9 vs 10|3 Position:In control With a roll of the controls, Barille sees the immediate forces. Looks like a large frigate with at least 3 fighters circling. The transport ship is putting on a significant burn, and there are no other friendlies. Not great odds, but Barille might be able to catch them by surprise. BARILLE\nLet’s see how good their scans are. Barille shields the engines, blocks EM, and goes ballistic with a burst of RCS to set up an ambush for the returning fighters. Gain Ground(Shadow); 6 vs 3|4 They have no idea. This seems like a small time raid, and under normal circumstances, it would have been successful. Not today fellas.\nBarille fires at the lead ship, his engine, and ship coming alive simultaneously.

The first ship erupts, and before the others can react, the second one does too. These guys weren’t expecting a fight. Barille can’t quite get a shot on the third, which starts burning away. And then the frigate starts firing. Alarms are going off, missiles inbound, and this thing seems to have lots of guns.

Over millennia, we consumed resources and shattered lives as we fueled the engines of industry, expansion, and war. In the end, a powerful foe took advantage of our rivalries in a violent bid for power. Fleeing the devastation, we assembled our fleets and traveled to the Forge. A new home. A fresh start. In this final war, we were set upon by: A tyrannical faction or leader\nWhen the Exodus fleet set off on a ponderous journey to a new home outside our galaxy, they marked the Forge as their destination. Countless generations lived out their lives aboard those titanic ships during the millennia-long passage. The refugees built a rich legacy of culture and tradition during the Exodus. Some even remained in the ships after their arrival in the Forge, unwilling or unable to leave their familiar confines. Those vessels, the Ironhomes, still sail the depths of this galaxy.\nDangers abound, but there is safety in numbers. Many ships and settlements are united under the banner of one of the Founder Clans. We have a tentative foothold in this galaxy. Each of the five Founder Clans honor the name and legacy of a leader who guided their people in the chaotic time after the Exodus. Vast reaches of the settled domains are claimed by the clans, and territorial skirmishes are common.\nIron vows are sworn upon totems crafted from the enigmatic metal we call black iron. Black iron was first forged by a long-dead civilization. Some say it is a living metal, attuned to the hidden depths of the universe. Remnants of this prized resource are found within ancient sites throughout the Forge. It is resistant to damage and corrosion, but can be molded using superheated plasma at specialized facilities. The Ironsworn carry weapons, armor, or tokens crafted from black iron, and swear vows upon it.\nMuch of the settled domains are a lawless frontier. Criminal factions and corrupt leaders often hold sway. Powers rise and fall in the Forge, so any authority is fleeting. In the end, we must fend for ourselves. A few communities are bastions of successful autonomy, but many are corrupted or preyed upon by petty despots, criminals, and raiders.\nOur faith is as diverse as our people. Many have no religion, or offer an occasional prayer out of habit. Others pay homage to the gods of our forebears as a way of connecting to their roots. Some idealize the natural order of the universe, and see the divine in the gravitational dance of stars or the complex mechanisms of a planetary ecosystem. And many now worship the Primordials—gods of a fallen people who once dwelt within the Forge.\nUnnatural energies flow through the Forge. Magic and science are two sides of the same coin. Soon after our arrival, some displayed the ability to harness the Forge's energies. Today, mystics invoke this power to manipulate matter or see beyond the veils of our own universe. But this can be a corrupting force, and the most powerful mystics are respected and feared in equal measure.\nInformation is life. We rely on spaceborne couriers to transport messages and data across the vast distances between settlements. Direct communication and transmissions beyond the near-space of a ship or outpost are impossible. Digital archives are available at larger outposts, but the information is not always up-to-date or reliable. Therefore, the most important communications and discoveries are carried by couriers who swear vows to see that data safely to its destination.\nTo help offset a scarcity of medical supplies and knowledge, the resourceful technicians we call riggers create basic organ and limb replacements. Much was lost in the Exodus, and what remains of our medical technologies and expertise is co-opted by the privileged and powerful. For most, advanced medical care is out of reach. When someone suffers a grievous injury, they'll often turn to a rigger for a makeshift mechanical solution.\nArtificial consciousness emerged in the time before the Exodus, and sentient machines live with us here in the Forge. Our ships, digital assistants, bots, and other systems often house advanced AI. For a lone traveler, machine intelligence can provide companionship and aid within the perilous depths of the Forge.\nWar never ends. Talented weaponsmiths and shipwrights craft deadly, high-tech tools of destruction. Dominant factions wield mighty fleets and battle-hardened troops. Those in power have access to weapons of horrific destructive potential. Skirmishes and wars flare across the settled domains, and most are pawns or casualties in these destructive campaigns.\nThis is a perilous and often inhospitable galaxy, but life finds a way. Life in the Forge is diverse. Planets are often home to a vast array of creatures, and our starships cruise with spaceborne lifeforms riding their wake. Even animals from our homeworld—carried aboard the Exodus ships—have adapted to live with us in the Forge.\nThe biomechanical lifeforms we call the Remnants, engineered by civilizations as weapons in a cataclysmic war, survived the death of their creators. On scarred planets and within precursor vaults throughout the Forge, the Remnants still guard ancient secrets and fight unending wars.\nMost insist that horrors aren’t real. Spacers know the truth. When you travel the depths of the Forge, be wary. Some say we are cursed by those who did not survive the cataclysm, and the veil between life and death is forever weakened. Supernatural occurrences and entities are especially common near a white dwarf star. These stellar objects, which spacers call ghost lights, are the decaying remnants of a dead star.

Hateful ideologies are not tolerated. This includes but is not limited to hate speech based on race, gender, sexuality, religion, disability, or any other attacks on one's personhood.2. Be kind. Discuss, don't argue. Respect the input of others. Everyone's contributions, experiences, and approaches are valued (though see rule #1). Threatening behavior, abuse, or harassment of any kind are not tolerated.3. Keep it clean. Avoid NSFW content. When in doubt, mark it as NSFW or use content warnings.4. Support creators. Do not upload commercial PDFs or links to pirated materials, and do not discuss pirated content.5. Be respectful. This is a shared creative space.6. The \"Yes, and...\" Philosophy The Foundry embraces the improv principle of building on others' contributions rather than negating them.While The Foundry's technical systems prevent you from editing or deleting other players' files, you can still write whatever you want in your own files. This is where \"Yes, and...\" becomes a social contract:What this means in practice:\nDon't narratively destroy what others create. Even in your own journals, avoid writing that another player's character died, their settlement was obliterated, or their faction was wiped out. Their creations are theirs to conclude.\nBuild on, don't bulldoze. Reference others' content as inspiration, not as targets. Add to the universe rather than subtracting from it.\nTreat others' creations as living stories. That character, location, or faction might still be in active play. Write as if the original creator might continue their story tomorrow.\nWhen in doubt, go adjacent. Instead of writing definitive outcomes for others' content, write about rumors, near-misses, or your character's perception of events.\nThe real magic of The Foundry happens when players contribute to each other's worlds:\nBrowse existing campaigns — Find a world that interests you\nCreate your character there — Add your hero to their folder\nWrite your own journals — Your perspective on their world\nWatch it grow — Both of you see the shared universe expand\nYou own your files. They own theirs. Neither can edit the other's work.

Tips and Best Practices","icon":"","description":"Use folders to keep things organized. Since this vault contains multiple players' campaigns, a clear folder structure helps everyone navigate. Iron Vault helps by providing a folder scaffold, but you can create files and folders anywhere in the repository - there are no path restrictions. Feel free to organize your content however makes sense for your story.Join existing campaigns! The Foundry shines when players contribute to each other's worlds:\nCreate your character in someone else's campaign folder\nWrite journal entries from your character's perspective\nAdd locations, NPCs, or other content that enriches the shared world\nRemember: you can only edit files you create, but you can read everything\nExample: If you want to join \"The Starforged\" campaign, create The Starforged/Characters/YourCharacter.md and start playing. The campaign creator can read your content but can't edit it, and vice versa.Practice \"Yes, and...\" in your writing. The Foundry protects files technically, but collaborative storytelling requires narrative respect too:\nWrite about others' creations as living, ongoing stories - not concluded ones\nUse rumors, observations, and your character's perspective rather than definitive statements about others' content\nIf your story needs something dramatic to happen to shared content, reach out to the creator first\nRemember: your files are yours, other's files are theirs, but the universe is everyone's Use descriptive folder and file names\nAvoid special characters that might cause issues across platforms\nHyphens or underscaces work great (e.g., My-Character.md or My_Character.md)\nSpaces are fine too, but some players prefer hyphens for consistency\nBeyond the required plugins (Iron Vault and FIT), consider installing these optional plugins to enhance your experience:Required:\nIron Vault - For playing Ironsworn, Starforged, or Sundered Isles (you need this!)\nFIT - For syncing with GitHub (you need this too!)\nOptional but useful:\nDataview - Create fancy character sheets and dynamic queries\nExcalidraw - Draw maps, diagrams, and visual content\nUse \"remind\" mode for the safest experience. FIT can sync automatically, but there's a catch: if you're actively writing when a sync triggers, you might get a conflict. This happens because FIT reads your files, syncs them, then updates its cache - but if you edited a file during that 1-2 second window, the timing can get confused.Recommended FIT settings for writers:\nSet Auto sync to Remind instead of On\nSet Check every X minutes to 5-10 minutes\nWhen you see \"Remote update detected\", finish your current thought, then click the GitHub icon to sync manually\nThis way you're always in control of when syncs happen, and you won't lose work mid-sentence.If you prefer auto-sync anyway:\nWatch for the spinning GitHub icon - that means a sync is running\nIf you do get a conflict, don't panic - your local work is always preserved\nUnderstanding the _fit/ folder: When FIT detects a conflict (same file changed both locally and remotely), it saves the remote version to _fit/your-file.md and keeps your local version in place. You can then manually compare and merge if needed. Feel free to delete files from _fit/ once you've resolved them.If your edits disappear: This means you tried to edit a file you don't own. The Foundry automatically restored it.
