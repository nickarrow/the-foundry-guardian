This is the beginning of a great adventure...
INT. LONG-RANGE TRANSPORT SHIP, RENTED CABIN
<a data-href="Barille Black" href="the-starforged-(nickarrow)/characters/barille-black.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Barille Black</a> is sleeping on a stiff bed, wearing his dark blue suit and tie, loosened at the neck. He has dark curly hair, and the stubble of a beard. Character Goal:Gain Riches, Seek Power <br>Growing up within the domain of a founder clan, the <a data-href="Circle of the Elder Stars" href="the-starforged-(nickarrow)/factions/circle-of-the-elder-stars.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Circle of the Elder Stars</a>, Barille's childhood was difficult. Not being of notable bloodline meant that he was relegated to the lower ranks of the Circle's caste system. However, his ability to fight, endure, and complete jobs earned him a reputation that helped elevate his status. Working jobs meant that he was able to grow his reputation, which provided access to bigger and better jobs. Barille has since left the Circle, for reasons unknown, and is currently adrift in the sector <a data-href="Devil's Chain" href="the-starforged-(nickarrow)/locations/sectors/devil's-chain.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Devil's Chain</a>, moving from job to job. <br>
When Barille left the Circle he made a vow, to <a data-href="Establish a new noble house in the Circle of the Elder Stars" href="the-starforged-(nickarrow)/progress/barille/establish-a-new-noble-house-in-the-circle-of-the-elder-stars.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Establish a new noble house in the Circle of the Elder Stars</a>. A house that would surpass all others and become the dominant authority within the faction. Barille is on a transport ship. Not having an FTL capable ship of his own, he has to buy or barter his way to systems or sectors. He is already on a job, a posted job for the <a data-href="Risen Union" href="the-starforged-(nickarrow)/factions/risen-union.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Risen Union</a> (RU). The RU has a reputation of keeping its cards close to the vest, but the jobs pay well, even if they tend to come with little information and lead to more questions than answers. Barille has sworn a vow for this job, to Investigate and report on the rumored horrors of Reck and he means to see it through. Barille is suddenly thrown out of his rented bed aboard the transport ship as the ship rocks violently. Either it is under attack or something catastrophic has happened. The damage is significant.BARILLE
Good gods. I’m trying to get some sleep TODAY! He stumbles to his feat, pushes buttons on the nearby panel trying to access the ship’s systems. Gather Information(Wits); 4 vs 5|3 Barille opens crew door to see klaxons flashing, people shouting down the call. He sees a crewman running by.BARILLE
Hey, what's going on? CREWMAN
We're under attack, someone's shooting! Yeah, this is not ideal. This is a transport, not a warship. Not wanting to explode, Barille reaches into his pocket and flips a black iron coin. He catches it and then says to himself.BARILLE
On this iron I swear to Swear an Iron Vow(Heart); 6 vs 9|5 Fend off attackers until the transport can escape Okay - not sure who these hostiles are, nor why they’d be going after us? Straight up piracy? Going to need to deal with the immediate, and very explody, problem - and then figure out who is actually attacking transport ships out here. Barille pulls up the UI from his hand terminal, and initiates the pre-launch sequence for his snub fighter. Green check marks. Great, let’s get there. Barille takes off to the hanger bay. Does he get there without issue? 50/50:Yes The ship rocks a bit, sounds like the transport pilot is making moves, but no major new strikes. Barille jumps into his SN-27 snub fighter, the engines are already humming. He punches the launch control and blasts out into the void.Enter the Fray(Snub Fighter / Integrity); 9 vs 10|3 Position:In control With a roll of the controls, Barille sees the immediate forces. Looks like a large frigate with at least 3 fighters circling. The transport ship is putting on a significant burn, and there are no other friendlies. Not great odds, but Barille might be able to catch them by surprise. BARILLE
Let’s see how good their scans are. Barille shields the engines, blocks EM, and goes ballistic with a burst of RCS to set up an ambush for the returning fighters. Gain Ground(Shadow); 6 vs 3|4 They have no idea. This seems like a small time raid, and under normal circumstances, it would have been successful. Not today fellas.
Barille fires at the lead ship, his engine, and ship coming alive simultaneously. Hello
<br> <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Campaigns/The Starforged/Characters/Barille Black/Barille Black.md" data-href="Campaigns/The Starforged/Characters/Barille Black/Barille Black.md" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Barille Black</a> <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="datasworn:move:starforged/combat/strike" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href=".html" target="_self" data-datasworn-id="move:starforged/combat/strike" data-datasworn-kind="move">Strike</a> Amount 1 From ambush Action die 2 Stat 1 Stat name Edge Adds 1 Score 4 Challenge die 1 4 Challenge die 2 9 Outcome Miss From 7 To 2 New score 7 Challenge die 1 4 Challenge die 2 9 Outcome Weak hit BARILLE BLACK
Yeaaaaaaaaaahh! The first ship erupts, and before the others can react, the second one does too. These guys weren’t expecting a fight. Barille can’t quite get a shot on the third, which starts burning away. And then the frigate starts firing. Alarms are going off, missiles inbound, and this thing seems to have lots of guns. Barille burns and rolls the ship to evade.
IN A BAD SPOT

First let's Begin a Session - Barille is walking along the busy market streets of... Settlement:Reprise The generate entity command with imbedded links is neato! Okay, wait, why is Barille here? Inciting Incident:Locate a downed spacer on an uninhabited planet Okay, so he is looking for information, maybe a clue that will help out somehow. First thing, let's do Gather Information(Wits); 4 vs 4|10 Miss. Yikes. What could the unwelcome truth be? Action + Theme:Arrive Creation - Okay that makes me think that this is a goldrush of sorts. The rumors of this downed spacer have created a ton of competition from treasure hunters and the like, looking to hit paydirt. This means that there are going to be lots of false leads, and competition along the way. But why? Descriptor+Focus:Conspicuous Technology Okay that this some sort of lost technology, maybe from the Exodus. Barille flips is black iron coin and to swear Swear an Iron Vow(Heart); 8 vs 7|7match A match! Momentum 2→4 All these poor sods, amateurs, this sort of tracking is what Barille does best! And a little competition is just going to make it more fun. Barille thinks about the vow he made when he took this job, Find and recovery the lost tech for the RU - In fact, so much excitement over the treasure hunt, he could use this to his advantage. Barille finds the nearest pub that looks like a rumor mill, and decides to buy a few drinks and send the fledgling treasure hunters in the wrong direction. Compel(Shadow); 5 vs 10|6 so.... that didn't work. Pay the Price means that he walked into the wrong pub. He was trying to plant information, but then realizes he's low-key surrounded. Looks like he's about to get jumped for information. "Guys, guys... what if we just split the reward money? eh? Any takers?" Enter the Fray(Wits); 6 vs 5|10 Momentum 4→6 They chuckle and then throw a beer bottle - Barille sees it happen and dodges over the bar as the barfight begins! Position:In a bad spot and this fight is going to be easy rank Escape the barfight Barille decides to leap back over the bar, maybe they were expecting a pushover? Clash(Iron); 7 vs 8|3 He tackles a smaller guy, and they definitely weren't expecting it Escape the barfight +1 (3/10) and then is kicked swiftly in the ribs by a massive beast of person Health 5→4 Okay fella's let's dance! Barille spins himself around and flips back onto his feat, he circles away from the front attackers - eyeing the door to leave on the far side of the room. React Under Fire(Wits); 4 vs 2|3 Only a three attackers, but one is big. Barille thinks he can take them. Momentum 6→7 and Position:In control A spin kick at the nearest guy, Strike(Iron); 🔥7 vs 5|7 with a little help from momentum Escape the barfight +2 (9/10) Position:In a bad spot he is able to take two of them down. But the big guy draws a pistol. Wow, this just got real. Barille kicks a chair in an attempt to knock the gun away, React Under Fire(Iron); 8 vs 9|9match , suddenly it all goes dark. Yeah, there was a forth guy... and he just clubbed Barille who is now unconscious. ]]></description><link>the-starforged-(nickarrow)/journals/barille-inline-mechanics-test-file.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">The Starforged (NickArrow)/Journals/Barille Inline Mechanics Test File.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 19:56:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[5.1 The Foundry Changelog Base]]></title><description><![CDATA[Changelog26 resultsSort1Filter0PropertiesNewfile namefile pathmodified time<a class="internal-link" href="the-starforged-(nickarrow)/characters/barille-black.html" draggable="true" target="_self">Barille Black</a>The Starforged (NickArrow)/Characters/Barille Black.md<a class="internal-link" href="the-starforged-(nickarrow)/the-starforged-(nickarrow).html" draggable="true" target="_self">The Starforged (NickArrow)</a>The Starforged (NickArrow)/The Starforged (NickArrow).md<a class="internal-link" href="the-starforged-(nickarrow)/journals/barille-01-beginnings.html" draggable="true" target="_self">Barille 01 - Beginnings</a>The Starforged (NickArrow)/Journals/Barille 01 - Beginnings.md<a class="internal-link" href="the-starforged-(nickarrow)/progress/barille/fend-off-attackers-until-the-transport-can-escape.html" draggable="true" target="_self">Fend off attackers until the transport can escape</a>The Starforged (NickArrow)/Progress/Barille/Fend off attackers until the transport can escape.md<a class="internal-link" href="the-starforged-(nickarrow)/progress/barille/investigate-and-report-on-the-rumored-horrors-of-reck.html" draggable="true" target="_self">Investigate and report on the rumored horrors of Reck</a>The Starforged (NickArrow)/Progress/Barille/Investigate and report on the rumored horrors of Reck.md<a class="internal-link" href="the-starforged-(nickarrow)/locations/settlements/reck.html" draggable="true" target="_self">Reck</a>The Starforged (NickArrow)/Locations/Settlements/Reck.md<a class="internal-link" href="the-starforged-(nickarrow)/locations/map-devil's-chain.excalidraw.html" draggable="true" target="_self">Map - Devil's Chain.excalidraw</a>The Starforged (NickArrow)/Locations/Map - Devil's Chain.excalidraw.md<a class="internal-link" href="the-starforged-(nickarrow)/locations/planets/ackriss-2.html" draggable="true" target="_self">Ackriss-2</a>The Starforged (NickArrow)/Locations/Planets/Ackriss-2.md<a class="internal-link" href="the-starforged-(nickarrow)/journals/barille-inline-mechanics-test-file.html" draggable="true" target="_self">Barille Inline Mechanics Test File</a>The Starforged (NickArrow)/Journals/Barille Inline Mechanics Test File.md<a class="internal-link" href="5.1-the-foundry-changelog-base.html" draggable="true" target="_self">5.1 The Foundry Changelog Base.base</a>5.1 The Foundry Changelog Base.base<a class="internal-link" href="5.-the-foundry-changelog.html" draggable="true" target="_self">5.

Iron Vault helps by providing a folder scaffold, but you can create files and folders anywhere in the repository - there are no path restrictions. Feel free to organize your content however makes sense for your story.Join existing campaigns! The Foundry shines when players contribute to each other's worlds:
Create your character in someone else's campaign folder
Write journal entries from your character's perspective
Add locations, NPCs, or other content that enriches the shared world
Remember: you can only edit files you create, but you can read everything
Example: If you want to join "The Starforged" campaign, create The Starforged/Characters/YourCharacter.md and start playing. The campaign creator can read your content but can't edit it, and vice versa.Practice "Yes, and..." in your writing. The Foundry protects files technically, but collaborative storytelling requires narrative respect too:
Write about others' creations as living, ongoing stories - not concluded ones
Use rumors, observations, and your character's perspective rather than definitive statements about others' content
If your story needs something dramatic to happen to shared content, reach out to the creator first
Remember: your files are yours, other's files are theirs, but the universe is everyone's Use descriptive folder and file names
Avoid special characters that might cause issues across platforms
Hyphens or underscaces work great (e.g., My-Character.md or My_Character.md)
Spaces are fine too, but some players prefer hyphens for consistency
Beyond the required plugins (Iron Vault and FIT), consider installing these optional plugins to enhance your experience:Required:
Iron Vault - For playing Ironsworn, Starforged, or Sundered Isles (you need this!)
FIT - For syncing with GitHub (you need this too!)
Optional but useful:
Dataview - Create fancy character sheets and dynamic queries
Excalidraw - Draw maps, diagrams, and visual content
Use "remind" mode for the safest experience. FIT can sync automatically, but there's a catch: if you're actively writing when a sync triggers, you might get a conflict. This happens because FIT reads your files, syncs them, then updates its cache - but if you edited a file during that 1-2 second window, the timing can get confused.Recommended FIT settings for writers:
Set Auto sync to Remind instead of On
Set Check every X minutes to 5-10 minutes
When you see "Remote update detected", finish your current thought, then click the GitHub icon to sync manually
This way you're always in control of when syncs happen, and you won't lose work mid-sentence.If you prefer auto-sync anyway:
Watch for the spinning GitHub icon - that means a sync is running
If you do get a conflict, don't panic - your local work is always preserved
Understanding the _fit/ folder: When FIT detects a conflict (same file changed both locally and remotely), it saves the remote version to _fit/your-file.md and keeps your local version in place. You can then manually compare and merge if needed. Feel free to delete files from _fit/ once you've resolved them.If your edits disappear: This means you tried to edit a file you don't own. The Foundry automatically restored it. Create your own file instead!

Can I rename or move my files?
Yes! You own your files, so you can rename, move, or delete them freely.Can I delete someone else's file?
No. The Foundry will automatically restore it.What if I accidentally edit someone else's file?
No worries! The Foundry will silently restore it on the next sync. No harm done.Can multiple people edit the same file?
No. Each file has exactly one owner. For collaborative content, create separate files that reference each other.How do I know who owns a file?<br>
If you created the file, you own it. If you didn't create it, you don't.

A shared narrative universe for Ironsworn, Starforged, and Sundered Isles players
The Foundry is a collaborative storytelling repository where players using Obsidian + Iron Vault can:
📖 Publish your campaigns — Share your adventures with the community
🔍 Explore others' stories — Read the campaigns, characters, and journals around you
🤝 Collaborate organically — Add your character to someone else's campaign, write journal entries that interweave with theirs
🌍 Build shared worlds — Watch the universe grow as players contribute to each other's stories
All governance happens automatically through GitHub Actions — no manual permission management, no drama.Every file has exactly one owner — whoever created it. Simple.What you can do:
✅ Create new files anywhere in the repository
✅ Edit, rename, move, or delete your own files
✅ Read everyone's files
❌ Edit or delete files owned by others
What happens if you try to edit someone else's file?The Foundry silently restores it. Your next sync pulls the corrected version. No errors, no drama, just clean content.

Playing in The Foundry? You can stop here — everything above is all you need. The rest is for contributors and those curious about how the system works.<br>For full technical details, see <a class="internal-link" data-href=".foundry/SPECIFICATION.md" href=".html" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">SPECIFICATION.md</a>, which covers:
Ownership model and registry system
Enforcement pipeline
Guardian protection system
Edge cases and implementation details Version Control: Git/GitHub
Automation: GitHub Actions (enforcement pipeline + external Guardian)
Ownership Registry: Centralized YAML with SHA-256 checksums
Sync Tool: FIT plugin for Obsidian
Game System: Iron Vault plugin for Obsidian
The Foundry uses a two-tier protection system:
Enforcement Pipeline — Runs on every push, validates ownership, reverts unauthorized edits
<br>External Guardian — Runs every 15 minutes from a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/nickarrow/the-foundry-guardian" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://github.com/nickarrow/the-foundry-guardian" target="_self">separate private repository</a>, protecting the enforcement infrastructure itself
Even if an attacker deletes all workflows, the Guardian restores everything within 15 minutes. Maximum vulnerability window: 15 minutes.Want to improve The Foundry itself (not just add campaign content)?

Threatening behavior, abuse, or harassment of any kind are not tolerated.3. Keep it clean. Avoid NSFW content. When in doubt, mark it as NSFW or use content warnings.4. Support creators. Do not upload commercial PDFs or links to pirated materials, and do not discuss pirated content.5. Be respectful. This is a shared creative space.6. The "Yes, and..." Philosophy The Foundry embraces the improv principle of building on others' contributions rather than negating them.While The Foundry's technical systems prevent you from editing or deleting other players' files, you can still write whatever you want in your own files. This is where "Yes, and..." becomes a social contract:What this means in practice:
Don't narratively destroy what others create. Even in your own journals, avoid writing that another player's character died, their settlement was obliterated, or their faction was wiped out. Their creations are theirs to conclude.
Build on, don't bulldoze. Reference others' content as inspiration, not as targets. Add to the universe rather than subtracting from it.
Treat others' creations as living stories. That character, location, or faction might still be in active play. Write as if the original creator might continue their story tomorrow.
When in doubt, go adjacent. Instead of writing definitive outcomes for others' content, write about rumors, near-misses, or your character's perception of events.
The real magic of The Foundry happens when players contribute to each other's worlds:
Browse existing campaigns — Find a world that interests you
Create your character there — Add your hero to their folder
Write your own journals — Your perspective on their world
Watch it grow — Both of you see the shared universe expand
You own your files. They own theirs. Neither can edit the other's work.

Over millennia, we consumed resources and shattered lives as we fueled the engines of industry, expansion, and war. In the end, a powerful foe took advantage of our rivalries in a violent bid for power. Fleeing the devastation, we assembled our fleets and traveled to the Forge. A new home. A fresh start. In this final war, we were set upon by: A tyrannical faction or leader
When the Exodus fleet set off on a ponderous journey to a new home outside our galaxy, they marked the Forge as their destination. Countless generations lived out their lives aboard those titanic ships during the millennia-long passage. The refugees built a rich legacy of culture and tradition during the Exodus. Some even remained in the ships after their arrival in the Forge, unwilling or unable to leave their familiar confines. Those vessels, the Ironhomes, still sail the depths of this galaxy.
Dangers abound, but there is safety in numbers. Many ships and settlements are united under the banner of one of the Founder Clans. We have a tentative foothold in this galaxy. Each of the five Founder Clans honor the name and legacy of a leader who guided their people in the chaotic time after the Exodus. Vast reaches of the settled domains are claimed by the clans, and territorial skirmishes are common.
Iron vows are sworn upon totems crafted from the enigmatic metal we call black iron. Black iron was first forged by a long-dead civilization. Some say it is a living metal, attuned to the hidden depths of the universe. Remnants of this prized resource are found within ancient sites throughout the Forge. It is resistant to damage and corrosion, but can be molded using superheated plasma at specialized facilities. The Ironsworn carry weapons, armor, or tokens crafted from black iron, and swear vows upon it.
Much of the settled domains are a lawless frontier. Criminal factions and corrupt leaders often hold sway. Powers rise and fall in the Forge, so any authority is fleeting. In the end, we must fend for ourselves. A few communities are bastions of successful autonomy, but many are corrupted or preyed upon by petty despots, criminals, and raiders.
Our faith is as diverse as our people. Many have no religion, or offer an occasional prayer out of habit. Others pay homage to the gods of our forebears as a way of connecting to their roots. Some idealize the natural order of the universe, and see the divine in the gravitational dance of stars or the complex mechanisms of a planetary ecosystem. And many now worship the Primordials—gods of a fallen people who once dwelt within the Forge.
Unnatural energies flow through the Forge. Magic and science are two sides of the same coin. Soon after our arrival, some displayed the ability to harness the Forge's energies. Today, mystics invoke this power to manipulate matter or see beyond the veils of our own universe. But this can be a corrupting force, and the most powerful mystics are respected and feared in equal measure.
Information is life. We rely on spaceborne couriers to transport messages and data across the vast distances between settlements. Direct communication and transmissions beyond the near-space of a ship or outpost are impossible. Digital archives are available at larger outposts, but the information is not always up-to-date or reliable. Therefore, the most important communications and discoveries are carried by couriers who swear vows to see that data safely to its destination.
To help offset a scarcity of medical supplies and knowledge, the resourceful technicians we call riggers create basic organ and limb replacements. Much was lost in the Exodus, and what remains of our medical technologies and expertise is co-opted by the privileged and powerful. For most, advanced medical care is out of reach. When someone suffers a grievous injury, they'll often turn to a rigger for a makeshift mechanical solution.
Artificial consciousness emerged in the time before the Exodus, and sentient machines live with us here in the Forge. Our ships, digital assistants, bots, and other systems often house advanced AI. For a lone traveler, machine intelligence can provide companionship and aid within the perilous depths of the Forge.
War never ends. Talented weaponsmiths and shipwrights craft deadly, high-tech tools of destruction. Dominant factions wield mighty fleets and battle-hardened troops. Those in power have access to weapons of horrific destructive potential. Skirmishes and wars flare across the settled domains, and most are pawns or casualties in these destructive campaigns.
This is a perilous and often inhospitable galaxy, but life finds a way. Life in the Forge is diverse. Planets are often home to a vast array of creatures, and our starships cruise with spaceborne lifeforms riding their wake. Even animals from our homeworld—carried aboard the Exodus ships—have adapted to live with us in the Forge.
The biomechanical lifeforms we call the Remnants, engineered by civilizations as weapons in a cataclysmic war, survived the death of their creators. On scarred planets and within precursor vaults throughout the Forge, the Remnants still guard ancient secrets and fight unending wars.
Most insist that horrors aren’t real. Spacers know the truth. When you travel the depths of the Forge, be wary. Some say we are cursed by those who did not survive the cataclysm, and the veil between life and death is forever weakened. Supernatural occurrences and entities are especially common near a white dwarf star. These stellar objects, which spacers call ghost lights, are the decaying remnants of a dead star. ]]></description><link>the-starforged-(nickarrow)/truths.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">The Starforged (NickArrow)/Truths.md</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 18:59:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[4.
